If you have one of the [supported boards](https://github.com/G4lile0/tinyGS/wiki/Ground-Station-configuration#current-available-boards) you just have to select it through the config dashboard of the ground station and the firmware will be configured acording to your hardware.

If you have a custom made board, or your board doesn't appear on the list, templates provide an easy way to create, modify and share pin configurations for any type of board you have without the need to modify the firmware. This is important not only because it makes it easier but also because it makes your configuration persistent after a firmware update.
