For the tinyGS groundstations to listen to a specific satellite, many parameters have to be adjusted. TinyGS provides with different methods to do so that can be classified in automatic or manual.

## Automatic tuning
On the local configuration dashboard of the board there is an option to enable or disable autoTuning.

If you enable this option, the server will configure your station to listen the most appropriate satellite and even change the configuration dynamically based on the satellites location and prediction so that your station maximizes the chances of receiving a frame.

At this moment this feature is experimental, but it will work reasonable well in most cases. 

## Manual tuning
